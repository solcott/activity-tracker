# dev/shared-display-text Specification

## Purpose
Has text that follows a rule (a quantity with its unit, a label with a fallback, a failure with its reason) chosen once in shared code, so the shared and the native UIs read the same and neither rewrites the rule.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Rule-bound text is chosen in shared code
Text whose wording follows a rule (a quantity with its unit, a label looked up by a token, a failure with its reason) SHALL be chosen by shared code that every client runs, as a shared string's name with its arguments, a plural with its quantity, or text as written. A UI SHALL only resolve that choice to the string its platform holds.

#### Scenario: A distance in each unit system
- **WHEN** 4,828 meters is formatted as a distance for an athlete who uses imperial units, and for one who uses metric
- **THEN** the shared and native UIs both read "3.00 mi", and both read "4.83 km"

#### Scenario: A missing value
- **WHEN** a pace is formatted for an activity with no distance
- **THEN** both UIs show the shared string for a missing value

#### Scenario: A sport's rate
- **WHEN** the average rate of a run, a ride, a swim and a yoga session is asked for
- **THEN** it is a pace, a speed, a pace per 100 meters or yards, and nothing, in both UIs

### Requirement: A token without a string falls back the same way everywhere
A label looked up by a token from an open set SHALL read as the shared string for that token where one exists, and otherwise as the fallback shared code names, identically in the shared and native UIs.

#### Scenario: A known sport
- **WHEN** the label of the sport `run` is shown
- **THEN** both UIs read "Run"

#### Scenario: An unknown sport
- **WHEN** the label of a sport token the app has no string for, `quidditch`, is shown
- **THEN** both UIs read "Quidditch"

#### Scenario: A sub-sport
- **WHEN** the label of a ride whose sub-sport is mountain biking is shown, and of a ride whose sub-sport the app doesn't name
- **THEN** both UIs read the sub-sport's own name for the first and "Ride" for the second

### Requirement: Error text is chosen once
What an error says SHALL be chosen by shared code from what failed and why, as `ui/error-messages` describes, and SHALL read the same in the shared and native UIs.

#### Scenario: A failure with a reason
- **WHEN** loading the feed fails because the server can't be reached
- **THEN** both UIs read "Couldn't load your feed. Couldn't reach the server."

#### Scenario: A failure without one
- **WHEN** loading the feed fails for a reason the athlete can't act on
- **THEN** both UIs read "Couldn't load your feed"

### Requirement: Every name shared code can choose exists
`./gradlew check` SHALL fail when shared code can choose a string or image name that the shared resources don't hold: for every kind of error and reason, every unit formatter in both unit systems, every closed label, and every sport's icon.

#### Scenario: A new kind of error without its string
- **WHEN** a kind of error is added and no string is added for it
- **THEN** `./gradlew check` fails and names the missing string

#### Scenario: A sport's icon is renamed away
- **WHEN** a drawable a sport's icon names is removed
- **THEN** `./gradlew check` fails and names it

### Requirement: Moving the choice changes nothing shown
Android, desktop and web SHALL show the same text and icons as before the choice moved to shared code.

#### Scenario: Reference screenshots
- **WHEN** the screenshot suite runs after the move
- **THEN** no reference image differs

### Requirement: Visibility choices read the same in both UIs
The name and help of each detail category, the note shown for Followers without approval, the note for a visibility that can't be chosen, and the note under each settings page's choices SHALL be chosen by shared code, and both UIs SHALL show that choice.

#### Scenario: Cadence without running form
- **WHEN** the cadence category is offered for an activity that records cadence but no running form
- **THEN** both UIs name it "Cadence", and for the defaults "Cadence and running form"

#### Scenario: A category the app doesn't name
- **WHEN** a detail category token the app has no name for is offered
- **THEN** both UIs show the token as it is

#### Scenario: A server without spaces
- **WHEN** an athlete's server doesn't host spaces
- **THEN** both UIs read "Your server doesn't support private activities yet, so they're Public." under the choices

#### Scenario: The segments note while saving
- **WHEN** segment matching is saving on a session that can use segments
- **THEN** both UIs read "Saving…" under the segment choices, and "Sign in again to use segments." instead on a session that can't

### Requirement: Gear reads the same in both UIs
A gear type's and kind's names, an item's usage total, the line under an item's name, and a collection's item count SHALL be chosen by shared code in the athlete's units, and both UIs SHALL show that choice.

#### Scenario: A kind the app doesn't name
- **WHEN** an item's kind is one this client has no name for
- **THEN** both UIs show its type's name in its place

#### Scenario: Skis in imperial
- **WHEN** skis have 14 days and 41,000 m of vertical and the athlete uses imperial units
- **THEN** both UIs read "14 days · 134,514 ft"

#### Scenario: A retired item where retirement is shown
- **WHEN** a retired bike visible to everyone is listed where retirement is shown
- **THEN** both UIs read "Bike · Public · Retired" under its name

### Requirement: The block lists read the same in both UIs
Each block list's title, empty message, remove action, the note for a block this app can't undo, and what failed when the list can't load SHALL be chosen by shared code, and both UIs SHALL show that choice.

#### Scenario: The muted list
- **WHEN** the muted list is shown
- **THEN** both UIs title it "Muted accounts" and offer "Unmute"

### Requirement: A paged list's statuses are decided once
What a paged list shows around its items in each loading state SHALL be decided by shared code that both UIs ask, so the two can't differ.

#### Scenario: A refresh of an empty list
- **WHEN** an answered list holds nothing and is refreshing
- **THEN** both UIs show the refresh's progress above and not the empty message

### Requirement: The Account page reads the same in both UIs
The sign-in status with an outdated grant's missing features in their order, each data export status's lines, and the end-session question's title, message and action SHALL be chosen by shared code, and both UIs SHALL show that choice.

#### Scenario: An outdated grant
- **WHEN** a grant is missing Leaving and Gear
- **THEN** both UIs list "Private gear, gear defaults and collections" before "Leaving Activity Tracker"

#### Scenario: Listing records
- **WHEN** an export is running and has listed no records yet
- **THEN** both UIs show the listing line and not a count of records

#### Scenario: Signing in again with an import saving
- **WHEN** the athlete chooses Sign in again while an import is saving
- **THEN** both UIs title the question "Sign in again?", say the import is saving, and offer "Sign in again anyway"

### Requirement: The Leave page reads the same in both UIs
The shared places' counts, the lines for what this device would lose, a running leave's step, its records deleted, and the time it was asked to wait until SHALL be chosen by shared code, and both UIs SHALL show that choice. The time SHALL follow the device's 12- or 24-hour clock.

#### Scenario: No shared places
- **WHEN** the athlete has no segments or dive sites
- **THEN** both UIs show the "none" line and no count

#### Scenario: A leave that hasn't reported a step
- **WHEN** a resumed leave has no step yet
- **THEN** both UIs read "Leaving Activity Tracker…"

#### Scenario: A 24-hour clock
- **WHEN** a leave was asked to wait until 19:05 on a device that uses a 24-hour clock
- **THEN** both UIs read "Carrying on at 19:05."
