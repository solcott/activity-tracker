# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A candidate holds what a segment needs
Each candidate SHALL hold its id, region, sport group, name, line, length in metres, source and licence. An OSM candidate SHALL have `source` `osm`, `license` `ODbL-1.0` and the ids of the OSM ways it follows. An agency candidate SHALL have `source` `agency`, `license` `CC0-1.0`, an attribution naming its agency, and the feature ids it follows. Its line SHALL be encoded as a `feed.segment` line is, stay within 1 m of the trail, and fit a `feed.segment` record; only a line that would not fit at 1 m SHALL be coarser, and then only as coarse as it needs to be to fit.

#### Scenario: Candidate written
- **WHEN** an extract gives a candidate for a 2 km ride trail
- **THEN** its entry holds a line within 1 m of the trail, a length of about 2000 m, `source` `osm` and `license` `ODbL-1.0`

#### Scenario: Switchbacks kept
- **WHEN** an extract gives a candidate for a trail mapped with nodes about 2 m apart around switchbacks about 10 m wide
- **THEN** its line follows each switchback around its turn, rather than cutting across it

#### Scenario: Forest Service candidate written
- **WHEN** the Forest Service's trails give a candidate for a 3 km hiking trail
- **THEN** its entry holds `source` `agency`, `license` `CC0-1.0`, the attribution "USDA Forest Service" and the feature ids it follows
